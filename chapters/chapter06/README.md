# Chapter 6

Code accompanying Chapter 4 of the book [Data Pipelines with Apache Airflow](https://www.manning.com/books/data-pipelines-with-apache-airflow).

## Contents

This folder contains DAGs from Chapter 6.

## Usage

To get started with the code examples, start Airflow with Docker Compose with the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The webserver initializes a few things, so wait for a few seconds, and you should be able to access the
Airflow webserver at http://localhost:8080.

To stop running the examples, run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose down -v
```
